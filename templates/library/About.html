                        Waterstones is Glasgow's first e-library that enables the 
                        students of Glasgow to read and educate themselves free of charge
                        This is an attempt to motivate students to constantly read without
                        worrying about a pric to pay. Without a physical store, students 
                        reserve a book that intrigues them and we will ship it to them within
                        1-2 business days. Students are able to reserve a book for 30 days,
                        and will be asked to return the book
